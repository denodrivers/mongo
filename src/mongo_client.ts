   * Optionally enable client side auto encryption

   * @remarks
   *  Automatic encryption is an enterprise only feature that only applies to operations on a collection. Automatic encryption is not supported for operations on a database or view, and operations that are not bypassed will result in error
   *  (see [libmongocrypt: Auto Encryption Allow-List](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/client-side-encryption/client-side-encryption.rst#libmongocrypt-auto-encryption-allow-list)). To bypass automatic encryption for all operations, set bypassAutoEncryption=true in AutoEncryptionOpts.
   *
   *  Automatic encryption requires the authenticated user to have the [listCollections privilege action](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/listCollections/#dbcmd.listCollections).
   *
   *  If a MongoClient with a limited connection pool size (i.e a non-zero maxPoolSize) is configured with AutoEncryptionOptions, a separate internal MongoClient is created if any of the following are true:
   *  - AutoEncryptionOptions.keyVaultClient is not passed.
   *  - AutoEncryptionOptions.bypassAutomaticEncryption is false.
   *
   * If an internal MongoClient is created, it is configured with the same options as the parent MongoClient except minPoolSize is set to 0 and AutoEncryptionOptions is omitted.
